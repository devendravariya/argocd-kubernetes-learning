#Kubernetes Deployment with Argo CD

This repository provides an example of how to deploy applications to Kubernetes using Argo CD, a declarative continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. Argo CD enables automated deployment, rollback, and monitoring of applications running in a Kubernetes cluster.

## Prerequisites

Before you can proceed with the deployment using Argo CD, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- [Kubernetes cluster](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/) - Set up a Kubernetes cluster or use an existing one.
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) - Install the Kubernetes command-line tool.
- [Argo CD](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/getting_started/) - Follow the official installation guide to install Argo CD in your cluster.

## Getting Started

To get started with the deployment, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
```

2. Navigate to the repository's directory:

```bash
cd your-repo
```

3. Update the Kubernetes manifests inside the `manifests/` directory according to your application's requirements. You can include deployment files, service files, ingress files, etc., in this directory.

4. Push the changes to your repository:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Update Kubernetes manifests"
git push
```

5. Open the Argo CD web UI using the Argo CD service URL. Authenticate using the credentials provided during installation.

6. Create a new application in Argo CD by clicking on the "New App" button. Provide a name for your application and set the source type to "Git."

7. Configure the application source details by specifying the repository URL, revision, and the path to the manifests directory (`manifests/`).

8. Set the destination namespace where you want the application to be deployed in the Kubernetes cluster.

9. Optionally, configure any other advanced settings like sync policy, health checks, or resource customizations.

10. Click on the "Create" button to create the application in Argo CD. Argo CD will automatically sync the application and deploy it to the specified namespace.

11. Monitor the application deployment and verify its status in the Argo CD web UI.

## Updating the Application

To update the deployed application, follow these steps:

1. Make the necessary changes to your Kubernetes manifests.

2. Push the changes to your repository:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Update Kubernetes manifests"
git push
```

3. Argo CD will automatically detect the changes and trigger a sync of the application. Monitor the deployment progress in the Argo CD web UI.

## Rollback

If you need to rollback to a previous version of the application, follow these steps:

1. Open the application details page in the Argo CD web UI.

2. Click on the "History" tab to view the deployment history.

3. Select the desired revision you want to rollback to and click on the "Rollback" button.

4. Argo CD will automatically rollback the application to the selected revision. Monitor the deployment progress in the Argo CD web UI.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during the deployment or have questions about using Argo CD, refer to the [official documentation](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/) for troubleshooting guides and FAQs. You can also reach out to the Argo CD community for support.
